# rasterexplorer
A package for quickly viewing raster datasets on an interactive map.

This package was inspired by the method `explore` (from GeoDataFrame objects) implemented by the package geopandas. As geopandas focuses on vector data, this package was created focusing on raster data. It provides a function, also named explore, that allows viewing raster datasets on an interactive map created using folium.

## Installation
Make sure you have rasterio and geopandas installed and run:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/lbferreira/rasterexplorer
```

## Usage examples
Coming soon.
